# Hand gesture decoding using EMG - a geometric perspective

The current narration around EMG based hand gesture decoding argues building for massive pretrained models trained using data from 100s of individuals.

Countering this argument, we show that EMG signals evince a rich geometric structure, that enables us to decode hand gestures of a given individual in an unsupervised manner simply using the raw signals.

We make use of symmetric positive definite covariance matrices, and operatae on a `Riemannian manifold`
